# WPtracSearch

This is a React powered application for searching WordPress trac tickets on an Elasticsearch cluster. 

## Background
Search within WordPress Trac is not great. It has fairly robust reporting options, but the full-text search leaves a lot to be desired.

It's so troublesome that many people use things like [Google](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1486058574007525?thread_ts=1486058574.007525) [Site](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1532602145000274) [Search](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1443762011000029). Though there are some thoughts that it's [not as great as it used to be](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC26G/p1546538307093800?thread_ts=1546538307.093800). 

Others [subscribe to the ticket update email firehose and use Gmail's built-in search](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1444062493000211). But that doesn't help anyone who didn't subscribe years ago. 

The other way these solutions fall short is that they don't allow additional filtering on the various taxonomies we use to categorize tickets. 

So I wrote a script to index all WordPress Trac tickets into an Elasticsearch cluster and built this simple interface for searching that system.

This application includes some logic from Ryan McCue's [Not Trac](https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac) â€” specifically the portions dealing with text parsing and formatting for TracLinks and code blocks.
